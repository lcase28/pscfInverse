## General plan
    Initially targeting particle phases
        Generation of "lattice" classes, similar to "crystals" package?
            Simply representation of lattice parameters, basis vectors, etc.
            No Particle positions
        Generation of "ParticlePhase" class
            Contains "lattice" for system general information
            Contains list of fractional positions
            Contains particle radius
                **Particle class??
