Updated 12 November 2019:

VERIFICATION
-- Verify sphere form factor class
-- Verify proper operation of FieldGenerator using Internal Lattice class over Crystals.Lattice
-- Finish unit tests on Lattice
-- Circle (2D cylinder) Form Factor Class
-- Operation of Update FieldGenerator to use Form Factor classes (For generic handling of all forms)
-- Operation of phaseManagement Module
-- Operation of VariableSet Objects (full... partial done)

UPDATE
-- Remove file handling from FieldGenerator -- make that class focused solely on calculation of concentration fields.
    -- Simply have utility to output kgrid as numpy ndarray

EXTEND/WRITE
-- Enable FieldGenerator to recognize lattice systems and accept fewer lattice parameters
    -- Initialize it from kgrid field file ???
        -- Use same file ???
            -- Possible issues with formatting changes between scft versions
        -- Extend file manager to generate a FieldGenerator object??
        -- FIGURE THIS OUT LATER
-- Finish Update method for pscfMesophase class (w/o actual pscf launch)
-- Link PscfMesophase class to a derived class of Agent
-- Set up directory structure for output. Establish regular output of swarm, agent, mesophaseManager statuses.
