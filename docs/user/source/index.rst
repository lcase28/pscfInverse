Introduction
============

PscfInverse joins  particle swarm optimization (PSO) with
self-consistent field theory (SCFT) calculations to serve 
as an inverse design engine for block copolymer systems
targeting bulk morphological self-assembly.
The program is written as a Python wrapper around the
existing open-source polymer self-consistent field (PSCF)
software
