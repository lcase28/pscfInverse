This directory contains resultant files from an erroneous PSCF convergence
for the BCC tetrablock terpolymer.

During this run, monomer labels 1 and 3 were flipped without changing the chi values
appropriately. The monomer inversions were done to match the density fields generated
(where monomer 1 is the particle core) from the original style done by Akash Arora with 
monomer 3 in the core.

A later convergence corrected the chi values and results should be available in another
directory.
