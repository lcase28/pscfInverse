This directory contains simplified trials of the SCFT PSO for the PSCF Fortran solver.
These trials circumvent the actual SCFT solution (they do not actually launch PSCF)
and instead are simply meant to verify proper generation of the directory structure
and proper writing of the files.

These trials will be obsolete once the scft launch capabilities are implemented in 
scftAgent, unless the launch is once againa over-ridden.

Input directory contains the source files used for these trials. 
each trial may, or may not, use all of them.

Trial 1 consists simply of BCC and A15 phase generation over 2 steps with 4 Agents.
