Next steps in development:

    -   Update handling of NaN energy in pscf output files to default to np.inf for
        consistent behavior.
    -   Add handling for non-particle phase types:
        -   Lamellar:
            Parameter handling is identical.
            Initial guess field can be easily generated using symmetrized format.
            In symmetrized format, composition is still the q=0 coefficient, then choose
            small number (say 0.1 * <lowest_composition>) as coefficient of first star.
            Parameter file will only need to convert from rho to omega before iteration.
        -   Network:
            Levelset method is known to have issues for other phases, but works for 
            Gyroid phase, which is ok to start. Implement this in a field generation class.
            Use similar approach to lamellar to start, then convert to rgrid using pscf.
            Read rgrid file, and perform levelset method. Initial guess will be input as
            rgrid file.
    -   Implement a Distributed Calculation Manager. Likely to use mpi4py.MPIExecutorPool
        as basis for new class (as multiprocessing.pool.Pool is in the local implementation).
    -   Implement interface for pscfpp in addition to pscf interfaces.
